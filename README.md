# Wine-Quality-Prediction-SVM

# Modeling Support Vector Machine to predict the wine quality of different types of wines.

Did some exploratory data analysis to know important features and did some correlation analysis to improve the model accuracy.

I used SVM's linear and rbf models to analyse how each technique works.
